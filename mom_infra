Hi Team,

Thank you for the discussion today. Please find below a summary of the key outcomes and next steps from our Kafka platform planning meeting.

Summary
We aligned on Q1 execution priorities across Kafka VM-to-physical migration, license reuse, upgrade strategy, automation, and infrastructure dependencies. The focus remains on delivering within the approved budget.

Key Takeaways
	•	All work must stay within the currently approved budget.
	•	VM-to-physical migrations should be planned to maximize license reuse; a consolidated view is required.
	•	Kafka upgrade planning will proceed with 7.9.x, with early planning needed for the KRaft transition.
	•	Kerberos removal and migration to mTLS/SSL are mandatory dependencies before NIC upgrades.
	•	Self-service automation and stability improvements are top priorities for Q1.

Action Items
	•	Prepare a consolidated VM migration and license reuse plan.
	•	Validate FIT approvals for OnePay and APAC clusters.
	•	Create an end-to-end dependency plan covering Kerberos removal, NIC changes, and upgrades.
	•	Continue and expand cluster health checks using internal automation.
	•	Publish automation status and roadmap in Confluence and align Jira tracking.


Thanks,
Rajeev
