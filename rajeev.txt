Weekly Work Summary (Nov 24, 2025 – Nov 28, 2025)
Focus Area: Kafka Dump
Kafka Dump – Architecture & Implementation Updates

Continued major work on the Kafka Dump automation, refining the workflow and improving script reliability.

Completed the Kafka dump flow diagram, capturing the full process from message retrieval → secure encryption → storage in Artifactory.

Began aligning the Kafka Dump logic with existing Citi security and tooling standards.

Migration from Python to Bash

Initially planned Kafka Dump automation in Python, but encountered a key blocker:

The required Confluent Python libraries (e.g., confluent-kafka-python) are not available in Citi’s approved internal repositories.

Due to strict dependency controls, adding or requesting new external libraries would introduce delays and approvals.

To avoid dependency bottlenecks and ensure compatibility with Citi’s hardened Linux environments, the implementation has been switched from Python to pure Bash.

Bash allows:

Direct use of Kafka CLI tools (kafka-console-consumer, kafka-dump-log, etc.)

Seamless integration with GPG encryption

Native compatibility with server environments

Faster deployment without external library dependencies

Artifactory Integration

Submitted a request for the updated Artifactory report, required for validating the upload paths and ensuring automated dump delivery aligns with internal compliance.

Validated the output structure and naming convention for encrypted dumps (.tar.gz.gpg) for Artifactory ingestion.

Script Enhancements & Workflow Refinement

Improved internal logging and workspace structuring under:
/var/log/confluent/kafka_dump/ (per INC/REQ/Topic)

Updated the encryption stage using AES-256 via GPG, ensuring compliance with Citi security policies.

Added audit logging to track:

Who triggered the dump

The request ID (INC / REQ)

Timestamp

Topic name

Artifactory upload result
