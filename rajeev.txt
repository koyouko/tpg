Dear Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an issue we are experiencing with our production brokers that is impacting our Kafka consumer performance.

Currently, we have observed that most of our production brokers are reaching the maximum limit of FETCH_SESSION slots (max.incremental.fetch.session.cache.slots). To mitigate this issue and improve our consumer efficiency, we kindly request an increase in the FETCH_SESSION slots from the current default value to 10,000. We believe that this adjustment will better align with our production needs and alleviate the current bottleneck.

In addition, we would also like to propose an adjustment to the group initial rebalancing delay (group.initial.rebalancing.delay.ms). Currently, it is set to 0 milliseconds, resulting in immediate rebalancing upon any consumer joining or leaving a group. To provide a more stable and controlled rebalancing process, we kindly request to adjust the delay to 3 seconds (group.initial.rebalancing.delay.ms=3000).

To implement these changes, we kindly ask you to add the following new broker properties:

max.incremental.fetch.session.cache.slots=10000
group.initial.rebalancing.delay.ms=3000

We believe that these adjustments will greatly improve the performance and stability of our Kafka ecosystem, allowing our consumers to handle larger workloads more efficiently.

If you require any additional information or have any concerns regarding these requested changes, please let us know. We appreciate your support and prompt attention to this matter.
